"""
Sample app that connects to a mqtt server and prints all sensor data.

It is possible to subscribe to only some sensors or to all of them.The program
blocks until cancelled by a keyboard interrupt.

To run the script you need to install the paho MQTT library:
pip install paho-mqtt

def on_connect(client, userdata, rc):
    print("Connected with result code " + str(rc))
    # Subscribing in on_connect() means that if we lose the connection and
    # reconnect then subscriptions will be renewed.

    # this subscribes only to the sfm sensor
    #client.subscribe("sensors/+/sfm/#")
    # this subscribes to all sensors
    client.subscribe("sensors/#")
